- **Acknowledgments**: Thanks to Prof. Luyao Zhang for her precious suggestions and teachings that made this project possible, and many thanks goes out to my classmates from Stats 201 for the productive discussions in class to perfect my hypothesis. Special thanks to Yiyang Zhang for peer reviewing my report and providing meaningful and impactful comments.
- **Project Summary**: 
n 1985, a major volcanic eruption occured in Columbia, the Nevado Del Ruiz volcano erupted in November, devastating the city of Armero, killing more than 20,000 people(Schuster and Highland 2001). The annual release of Carbon Dioxide from Volcanic activitites is 0.28-0.36 gigatons(Collins 2019). It would be enlightening to see how much impact this number of carbon emission actually has on the global scale of carbon emissions. Because the Carbon concentration measured is in the global scale, a major volcanic eruption is preferred to be studied so that its effects may be more obvious than an average-sized eruption or minor volcanic activities. The Armero tragedy was one of the biggest volcanic eruptions in the recent decades that has data on carbon concentration, thus we select to study this particular eruption. The study will analyze monthly data of carbon concentration in the atmosphere from the past few decades. We will apply causal inference to the major volcanic eruption of Nevada Del Ruiz in 1945. In hopes of acquiring a deeper understanding of the relationship between the variable and the potential impact of volcanic eruptions
